# InwentaryzacjaAPI
API for a mobile app student project. We are currently developing a 
mobile app for Android which will be used for stocktaking of assets 
belonging to our university (in theory). I thought of it as a great
opportunity to put my PHP skills to a test and create an API which
will enable us to query an external server's database for data.

The entire project is written in vanilla PHP.
